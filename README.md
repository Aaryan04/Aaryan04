# 👋 Hi there, I'm Aaryan Shah

🎓 Master’s Student in Applied Data Science @ USC  
💡 I design intelligent systems that scale — from data pipelines to machine learning to analytics

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a data-driven engineer who thrives at the intersection of **big data engineering**, **analytics**, and **software development**. I enjoy building **scalable data pipelines**, developing **machine learning applications**, and working with **large language models (LLMs)** to create real-world impact. With a solid foundation in **AI/ML** and strong technical skills, I aim to bridge the gap between raw data and business-ready insights.

Currently pursuing my Master’s at USC, I’m passionate about designing systems that are not only intelligent but also robust, efficient, and production-ready.
